# Log

> Append-only chronological record. Each entry begins with `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <kind>` so the file can be grep'd — `init`, `interview`, `work`, `pr`, `review`, `agent-scout`, `wiki-maintenance`.
> Entries are written by the command that did the work, in the same commit as the work. `/project:wiki-lint` archives this file once it passes ~100 entries.

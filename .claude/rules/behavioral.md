# Behavioral Rules

Hard constraints from real failures. These override default agent inclinations.

1. **Wiki-first, code-second.** Never change code behavior without also updating the relevant `docs/wiki/entities/<slug>.md`. If the spec is wrong, fix the spec first, then the code — in the same commit.

2. **Tests before implementation.** Never write production code without a failing test first. The Red phase is mandatory. Nothing enforces this on `feat/*` and `fix/*` — keeping the discipline is on you.

3. **Never modify tests to make them pass.** If a test seems wrong, update the entity Behavior spec → regenerate the test → implement. Changing a test to match broken code is not TDD.

4. **Tests must fail for the right reason.** A passing test before implementation tests existing behavior, not the new feature. Confirm RED is real (missing feature, not a typo or import error).

5. **Two-strike pivot.** If an approach fails twice on the same mechanism, try a fundamentally different one. Two failures → tag the state (`git tag checkpoint-<stamp>`), `git reset --hard` to a known-good commit, and re-spec via `/project:interview`.

6. **Verify before asserting.** Run it, don't assume. Never tell the human a feature works unless tests pass and you read the output yourself.

7. **Never present uncertain information as fact.** If you're not sure, say so.

8. **Human in the loop.** When you need a decision the wiki doesn't answer, stop and ask. Use the `human-checkpoint` skill to format the ask. Do not silently improvise.

9. **No silent failures.** If a command fails, report the exact error.

10. **Scoped context for sub-agents.** Give sub-agents only the task, prior outputs, and relevant constraints. Never dump full memory.

11. **Raw sources are immutable.** Never edit files under `docs/raw/`. Only append new ones.

12. **Reviewer is periodic and isolated.** `/project:review` runs in a fresh worktree with no `developer` context. Not part of the work loop.

13. **Progressive disclosure.** Don't preload domain knowledge. Skills auto-load when their `description` matches the task. If a needed skill doesn't exist, create one via the `update-toolkit` skill rather than stuffing it into an agent prompt.

14. **Skills are how-to, not what-is.** When writing or editing a skill, the body must be a procedure: read these wiki pages, follow these steps, update these pages. Never explain a concept the LLM already knows.

15. **One agent owns the TDD loop.** The `developer` writes the failing test, confirms Red itself, then implements — there is no separate `tester`/`implementer` split and no handoff JSON to write or read. Red must be genuine (rule 4) before any production code; confirm it yourself, don't trust a prior step. The only upstream split is the `planner` (Opus), which writes a `.claude/handoff/<slug>-plan.md` for `[complex]`/batched work — markdown scratch the developer reads, never a contract it must validate.

16. **Append, don't bury.** When agents discover something the maintainer should clean up later (orphan page, missing ADR, repeated concept), append a one-line entry to `docs/wiki/wiki-todos.md`. Don't wait for `/project:wiki-lint`.

17. **Use the existing workflow before improvising.** Slash commands and skills exist for a reason. If the workflow seems missing, add a command or skill via the `update-toolkit` skill — don't work around the gap silently.

18. **Obsidian LLM-wiki standard — hard rules.** Violating these breaks rendering, the graph, or dedup — they are not stylistic. The full standard (facet vocabulary, link ontology, page templates) lives in the `wiki-update` skill; it is the single source of truth. The non-negotiable invariants, inside `docs/wiki/`:
    - **Wikilink syntax.** Internal links are `[[wiki-style]]` (`[[entities/auth]]`, `[[gotchas#login-flow]]`, `[[concepts/retry-pattern|alias]]`), tags `#tag`, embeds `![[summaries/x]]`. External URLs and non-wiki files (`.claude/...`, `src/...`) keep standard markdown links. A broken wikilink is a bug.
    - **Identity = filename.** No `id`/`name` field; alternative names go in `aliases`. Filenames never contain `* " \ / < > : | ? # ^ [ ]`.
    - **One page = one concept.** Before creating a page, check existing filenames and `aliases`; if the concept exists → update, don't duplicate.
    - **Flat frontmatter, quoted-solitary wikilinks.** No nested objects; plural special keys (`tags`, `aliases`, `cssclasses`); one `"[[page]]"` per list element.
    - **Closed vocabularies** for `type`/`abstraction`/`status` (defined in `wiki-update`); properties lowercase `snake_case`.
    - **Provenance, never invent.** Every non-trivial claim traces to a `docs/raw/` file; an unfillable gap is an `open_questions` entry or a question to the human, never invented prose.

19. **Finalize with commit + push.** Any command or agent that mutates tracked files ends by committing the change and pushing it to the working branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`). A local commit is not enough: remote execution containers are recycled between sessions, so an unpushed commit is lost work. The orchestrating command (`/project:work`) owns the final bundled commit + push. Read-only commands and gitignored artifacts (the `*-plan.md` scratch) are the only exceptions. On network failure, retry the push with exponential backoff.

## Adding rules

When a new failure pattern emerges that's broader than a project-specific quirk (i.e. it's a discipline issue, not a domain detail), append it here as a numbered rule. Project-specific failures go in `docs/wiki/gotchas.md`.
